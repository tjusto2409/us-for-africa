        <h1>Ministries</h1>
        <p>
          Churches and ministries in Africa provide community and connection. 
          They are the foundation for all the work we do. 
          Churches meet the critical needs of the villages and cities they serve and provide hope through the powerful message of 
          the cross and the saving sacrifice of Jesus. 
          The power of the gospel is at work in Africa, and we seek to expand the reach and spread the good news and power of God 
          across nations.          
        </p>
