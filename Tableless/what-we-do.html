                <span>Africans are vibrant, beautiful people</span> who the media portray as dirty and destitute. Because of this narrow view, 
                most people have a distorted understanding of Africa and its citizens.
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                But just like any continent, Africa has pockets of poverty. Kids go hungry, and adults yearn for a purpose.
              </p>
              <p class="text">  
                <span>Africa is a costly place to live.</span> According to the World Bank, low incomes do not sustain the high cost of living. The prices of goods and services 
                in urban African environments can be up to 30% higher than average.*
              </p>
              <p class="text">  
                Additionally, nearly half of all African residents are under the age of 18. And half of those are under the age of 12. 
                These kids are too young to enter the workforce or contribute financially. 
                <span>They rarely have access to proper education, especially in their formative years. </span>
                This prevents them from pursuing meaningful work and can inhibit their growth as they age.
              </p>
              <p class="text">  
                All these factors contribute to a low life expectancy. Statistics like these can paint a picture of poverty and despair. 
                <span>But hope and a desire for change are inherent in the African people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="text">  
                Pastors hold a special place in African culture. They have influence and bring real help to those they serve. 
                But to be successful in their work, pastors and community leaders need funds, training, and support. 
                The organic way pastors are embedded in their communities provides a voice to the hopeless, help to the broken, and love to all.
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                When leaders are healthy, organizations have a greater influence.

                  Churches and ministries in Africa provide community and connection. They are the foundation for all the work we do. Churches meet the critical needs of the villages and cities they serve and provide hope through the powerful message of the cross and the saving sacrifice of Jesus. The power of the gospel is at work in Africa, and we seek to expand the reach and spread the good news and power of God across nations.

                <p class="text">
                  While serving in Mozambique, Washington and Silvia established schools and educational TV programming for parents. 
                  They have seen over 1,000 children complete their early childhood training and experience the love and power of God. 
                  Education in African culture provides many obstacles for children. 
                  There’s no common language in Africa. Countries and villages have various dialects. 
                  Because most children don’t attend school until the age of 7, they are thrust into a learning environment while learning a new language.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                  Structure and education are vital for every child. Neuroscientists say that the first 5 years of childhood development are critical, especially as foundations
                  for later growth. Through our school programs, kids receive important early education they would otherwise lack. 
                  The curriculum provides foundational instruction including colors, numbers, letters, and language. By providing books, classrooms, and supplies, 
                  we are able to prepare children for the next phase of their schooling in a safe, loving, and fun environment.

                  They are full of hope and excitement as they contribute to their families and neighborhoods. Small businesses provide income for families and revitalize

                <p class="text">
                  This is a proven method across the globe for outreach and missions. When people’s basic needs are met, they are more receptive to the gospel message.
